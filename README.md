## Testing

To test the function of the application, after you either launch from GitHub pages or from your own browser, type a city into the search bar. The current weather conditions as well as the 5-day forecast should populate in the empty fields. When the page is refreshed it should show the results of the last city you searched. If no reults are displaying, it's possible the api key is no longer working, please contact me so this can be addressed.
